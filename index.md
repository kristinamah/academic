This project aims to understand the link between trust, safety, and the public acceptance of driverless cars. The uptake of autonomous mobility systems relies upon public trust. Recent injuries, and even a fatality, have highlighted the risks they pose to pedestrians in particular. The project investigates new interfaces for improving public trust and pedestrial safety by allowing vehicles to communicate with the people around them. Along the way, it develops a validated approach for simulating real interactions with autonomous vehicles in a virtual-reality environment. Benefits include strategies for making driverless cars safer for pedestrians and a new approach for testing solutions to this emerging problem in a low-cost, low-risk way.
